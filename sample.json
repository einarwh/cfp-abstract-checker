            "title": "Unveiling the Divide: Exploring Disparities Between Human-Crafted and AI-Generated Abstracts in Software Development",
            "description": 
            "In an era dominated by artificial intelligence, the landscape of content creation is undergoing a transformative shift. This talk at NDC Oslo delves into the intriguing realm of abstract writing, comparing and contrasting the nuances between abstracts crafted by human hands and those generated by advanced AI tools like ChatGPT. Join us on a journey to unravel the intricacies, biases, and stylistic variations that distinguish the two approaches. By examining real-world examples and conducting insightful analyses, we aim to shed light on the evolving role of AI in shaping how we communicate complex ideas in the realm of software development. As we navigate through the terrain of language generation, we'll explore the potential impact on audience engagement, comprehension, and the overall perception of technical content. Attend this session to gain a fresh perspective on the intersection of human creativity and artificial intelligence in the context of abstract writing for software development conferences."

            "title": "Decoding the Consciousness Conundrum: Are Large Language Models Philosophical Zombies?",
            "description": 
            "Embark on a thought-provoking journey with us at this 60-minute session as we delve into the profound question of whether large language models, such as GPT-3, should be deemed as philosophical zombies. In the realm of software development, where artificial intelligence is advancing at an unprecedented pace, understanding the ethical and philosophical implications becomes crucial. We will navigate through the characteristics of philosophical zombies, entities that exhibit intelligent behavior without subjective experience, and explore the parallels with the capabilities of cutting-edge language models. Join the discussion on the ethical considerations surrounding the development and deployment of these models, examining their potential impact on decision-making, bias, and societal implications. This session aims to provoke contemplation, spark debate, and provide insights into the intersection of AI, consciousness, and the responsibilities of developers in shaping the future of intelligent systems."
